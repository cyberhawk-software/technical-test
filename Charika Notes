First of all, I am sorry that I cannot use Docker as my machine is old and motherboard does not support WSL2 to install Docker Desktop :( .
 
I assumed the app should be a CRUD. Therefore I started with Resource Route
But did not spend the time to complete CRUD as it is not the main task

Really wanted to try some Tailwind CSS. Unfortunately that is also not working.
I wanted to create a grid and put the Turbines into cells.
I have used Bootstrap 5 to create the GUI. I am not a brilliant front end designer. I did my best.

Lastly spent a lot of time trying to fix the machine, but I can't touch the motherboard settings.
SO if I have more time I would like to do some Automate testing. Let me know.

Hope I did not waste your time creating some crap. If so I am really sorry. Will try next time one day !!

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to take the technical test.
Have a great day
Charika
